# Server Rules

    The whole point of playing together is to have fun!  However, with Minecraft being as open as
    it is, its worth taking a moment to be sure everyone is on the same page about what we
    consider to be fun. The general aim for this server is to enable people to enjoy building stuff
    either on their own or together as they like. Here are some particulars about what that means:

      * No uninvited player vs. player combat.
      * Do not disturb anything which appears to have been made by another player.
      * Do not build anything within sight of another player's constructions without talking it
        over with them first.
      * Make it easy for others to figure out that you made something.
      * Don't tear up the landscape without making something better out of it.



# Getting Started Tips

Be aware of these new game mechanics:

    Thirst              Just like hunger, you can now become thirsty. Carry a full bottle or
                        canteen to drink from and keep yourself healthy. YOU CANNOT HEAL WHEN
                        THIRSTY OR HUNGRY. However, you heal much more quickly.

    Temperature         You can now become too hot and too cold. The large globe in the center of
                        your HUD will range from blue to red to indicate temperature (changing to
                        a snowflake or fire when dangerous). You can eventually take damage and
                        die from exposure.

    Seasons             A Minecraft year is defined as being 84 Minecraft days long, with each
                        season taking 21 days.
                        This will cause all the usual changes in temperature, ability to grow
                        crops, precipitation, etc.  Plan your home and travels accordingly.

    Carrying            You can shift-right-click animals and chests to pick them up. This will
                        slow you down a bit, and then you can right-click the ground to drop it.

In addition to the usual things, concentrate on making these items early:

    Lunch Bag:          Using the same bucket recipe with paper will get you a lunch bag. Shift-
                        right-click to open, and then right-click a chest with food in order to
                        grab food you haven't eaten recently. Upgrade to a Lunch Box when you have
                        some iron ingots.

    Bottle:             Since thirst is now a real concern, you'll want to make an ordinary bottle
                        early on so you can drink.  Once you have enough leather, make a Canteen.

    Clay Bucket:        Iron is quite a bit harder to come by in this modpack, but you can make a
                        clay bucket with just plain clay using the same recipe. Fire the bucket in
                        a furnace, and you're ready to go.

    Tin/Copper Tools:   As mentioned, iron is much harder to come by.  Start with tin or copper
                        tools until you're ready to smelt bronze.
